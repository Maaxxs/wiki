# Printing

## Print double-sided pages

How to print double-sided pages with a printer which doesn't explictely support
that mode.

1. Print only *even* pages in *reverse* order
2. Take the pages from the printer and turn them 180 degrees horizontally (pages
   usually come out of the printer head first and they need to go into the
   printer head first as well)
3. Print all *odd* pages.
