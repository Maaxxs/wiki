## What this is

- I'd to use this as a little memory aid.
- Mostly Markdown files, will probably be rendered as html and available on my
  website
- Infos on Archlinux
- Configurations (maybe files) for some services such as ssh, nginx, systemd
- Good talks on some topics

## Knowledge Management

From a simple wikipedia style of taking notes, I recently switched to other
_tools of thought_ such as 

- [Logseq](https://logseq.com) (open-source)
- [AthensResearch](https://roamresearch.com) (open-source)
- [RoamResearch](https://roamresearch.com) 
- [RemNote](https://www.remnote.io/)

I still find myself using these notes quite often. It's quite nice to commit
notes into git and serve them statically as public webpages while they are
completely searchable (thanks to [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)).
