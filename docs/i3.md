# i3

Not only i3 configuration but also related stuff. Like how to change cursor
size and theme...

My i3 configuration is
[here](https://gitlab.com/Maaxxs/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/i3/config).


## Cursor size

The package `xorg-xrdb` needs to be installed.

`~/.Xresources`
```
Xcursor.size: 16
```

In `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini` and `~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini` add
```
gtk-cursor-theme-name=Adwaita
```

Create file with default theme:

`.local/share/icons/default/index.theme`
```
[icon theme] 
Inherits=Adwaita
```
