# Thunderbird

In the calendar the default double click action is to *view* the event.
Then you have to click *modify* in the lower right corner.
How annoying.

To change this:

1. go to `about:config` (Settings -> General -> at the bottom "Edit Configuration")
2. Change `calendar.events.defaultActionEdit` to True.
