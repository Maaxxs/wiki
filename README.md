# Wiki

**See the [Gitlab Wiki](https://gitlab.com/Maaxxs/wiki/wikis/home) page for the Wiki!**

## What it is

- I'd to use this as a little memory aid.
- Mostly Markdown files, maybe packed into pdfs
- Infos on Arch Linux (installing, programs I use, themes)
- Configurations (maybe files) for some services such as ssh, nginx, systemd
- Good talks on some topics

## What it's not

- It should **not** be a second "wikipedia" in any way
