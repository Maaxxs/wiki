## What this is

- I'd to use this as a little memory aid.
- Mostly Markdown files, will probably be rendered as html and available on my website
- Infos on Arch Linux (installing, programs I use, themes) (not anymore)
- Configurations (maybe files) for some services such as ssh, nginx, systemd
- Good talks on some topics

## Knowledge Management

From a simple wikipedia style of taking notes, I switched to [RoamResearch](https://roamresearch.com) recently.
Time will tell how this works out.
